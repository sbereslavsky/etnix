//Every context starts by attaching a ContextView to a GameObject.
//The main job of this ContextView is to instantiate the Context.
//Remember, if the GameObject is destroyed, the Context and all your
//bindings go with it.

//This ContextView holds the UI. It can be helpful to break apart your
//game into multiple scenes and multiple Contexts. In particular,
//this split allows one dev/team to work on the UI while a different dev
//or team works on the game.
